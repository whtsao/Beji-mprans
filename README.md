Beji's experiment can be referred to paper 'Numerical simulation of nonlinear wave propagation over a bar (1994)'

Numerical configuration:

rans2p_beji93: The outlet is an impermeable ramp to a level above the water surface.

rans2p_beji93_mod1: The outlet is an impermeable ramp to a level under the water surface. Then the absorption zone is set in the ned of the channel to reduce reflected waves.
